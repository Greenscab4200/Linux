		<h2>What Is Linux?</h2>
		<p>
            Linux is a free and open-source operating system, which means that anyone can download it, use it, and modify it. There are many different versions of Linux, called "distributions," but they all share certain features and characteristics.
        </p>
        <h2>Here are some basic concepts you should be familiar with when using Linux:</h2>
        <p>
            1.) Terminal: Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux does not have a graphical user interface (GUI) by default. Instead, you interact with the system through a command-line interface called the terminal. You type commands into the terminal, and the system responds by executing those commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            2.) File system: In Linux, everything is a file. The file system is organized hierarchically, with the root directory at the top ("/"). Files and directories are represented by paths, which are strings that indicate their location in the file system. For example, "/home/user/myfile.txt" is the path to a file called "myfile.txt" in the "user" directory, which is inside the "home" directory, which is at the root of the file system.
        </p>
        <p>
            3.) Permissions: Linux has a very fine-grained permission system that controls who can access files and directories, and what they can do with them. Every file and directory has an owner and a group, and there are three types of permissions: read, write, and execute. You can use the "chmod" command to change permissions on files and directories.
        </p>
        <p>
            4.) Package management: Linux distributions come with a package manager, which is a tool for installing, updating, and removing software. Different distributions use different package managers, but they all work in a similar way. You can use the package manager to install software from a central repository, which makes it easy to keep your system up-to-date and secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            5.) Shell scripting: Linux has a powerful scripting language called Bash, which allows you to write scripts to automate tasks and perform complex operations. Shell scripts are text files that contain a series of commands, which are executed in order when the script is run.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are just a few of the basic concepts you'll need to know to get started with Linux. Once you get familiar with the basics, you'll find that Linux is a powerful and flexible operating system that can do just about anything you need it to!
